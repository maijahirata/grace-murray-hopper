                    <h3>Contributions to Computer Science:</h3>
                    <p><b>Grace Murray Hopper</b> earned a master’s degree and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale and 
                        was most known for her astounding contributions to computer programming, software 
                        development and the design and implementation of programming languages. In 1949, Hopper 
                        joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in Philadelphia as a senior mathematician 
                        where she pioneered the idea of automatic programming and new ways to use a computer to code.
                        In 1952, she developed the first compiler named A-0, which translated mathematical code into 
                        machine-readable code, which is the <i>core of modern programming languages.</i> In 1953, she 
                        proposed the idea of writing programs in words rather than symbols, and despite being told that
                        her idea would not work, in 1956, she and her team were running FLOW-MATIC, or the first
                        programming language to use word commands where she also demonstrated how programs could
                        be written in word-based languages other than English.</p>
